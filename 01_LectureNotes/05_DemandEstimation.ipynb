    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this notebook, you should be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Explain why demand estimation is central in Industrial Organization and competition policy.\n",
    "2. Connect demand estimation to **measurement of market power** (Lerner index, elasticities).\n",
    "3. Distinguish between **Cournot** and **Bertrand** competition and see why Bertrand is the natural benchmark with differentiated products.\n",
    "4. Understand the basic structure of:\n",
    "   - The simple **Multinomial Logit** model,\n",
    "   - The **Nested Logit** model,\n",
    "   - The **BLP (Berry–Levinsohn–Pakes)** random-coefficients logit approach at a conceptual level.\n",
    "5. Implement, in Python:\n",
    "   - A **logit demand estimation** with aggregate market shares,\n",
    "   - A **nested logit demand estimation** with segments as nests,\n",
    "   - Construction and use of **BLP-style instruments** for price and nest share endogeneity.\n",
    "6. Compute **own- and cross-price elasticities** and **implied marginal costs** from the estimated model.\n",
    "\n",
    "We’ll do this through a **hands-on example** using the European car market, closely following the structure of problem sets used in empirical IO courses, but treated here as a guided lecture rather than an assignment."

    "## 1. Why do we estimate demand?\n",
    "\n",
    "In IO and antitrust, **demand** is not just \"how much people buy\". It is a **function** that links quantities (or market shares) to:\n",
    "  - Prices,\n",
    "  - Product characteristics (quality, horsepower, fuel efficiency, etc.),\n",
    "  - Income and other demand shifters,\n",
    "  - Unobserved factors (brand reputation, design, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "Why we care:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Pricing and markups**\n",
    "   - If we know the **own-price elasticity** of a product, and we have some assumptions on competition (e.g. Bertrand pricing), we can infer **markups** and **marginal costs**.\n",
    "   - This is key for measuring **market power**.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Merger analysis**\n",
    "   - Competition authorities want to know:\n",
    "     - If two firms merge, how will they change prices?\n",
    "     - Which products are close substitutes?\n",
    "   - Demand estimation allows you to simulate how **prices and quantities** move after a merger.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Policy simulations**\n",
    "   - \"What if\" questions:\n",
    "     - What if we impose a tax/subsidy on certain products (e.g., fuel-inefficient cars)?\n",
    "     - What if a new product enters or an existing product exits?\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Product design and differentiation**\n",
    "   - Firms can use demand estimates to decide:\n",
    "     - Which segment to target,\n",
    "     - Whether to launch a new variant (e.g., SUV vs compact).\n",
    "\n",
    "In short: estimating demand is essential for **measuring market power** and for **counterfactual analysis** in IO and antitrust."

    "   - Aggregate logit can be written as a **linear regression** in \\( \\ln(s_j / s_0) \\).\n",
    "3. Extended to **nested logit** to relax the IIA assumption and capture within-segment substitution.\n",
    "4. Addressed **price endogeneity** (and nest-share endogeneity) using **BLP-style instruments**.\n",
    "5. Computed **elasticities** and **marginal costs** under **Bertrand pricing**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conceptually, **BLP** adds one more layer:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Instead of assuming all consumers share the same β and α (representative consumer),\n",
    "- BLP allows these parameters to vary across individuals (random coefficients),\n",
    "- This leads to **richer substitution patterns** and more realistic simulations.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Competition authorities (like PCC, EC, US-DOJ, CMA) use variants of these models to:\n",
    "  - Evaluate **mergers**,\n",
    "  - Analyze **remedies**,\n",
    "  - Assess **dominance** and **abuse of dominance**,\n",
    "  - Design **sectoral regulations**.\n",
