    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this notebook, you should be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Explain why demand estimation is central in Industrial Organization and competition policy.\n",
    "2. Connect demand estimation to **measurement of market power** (Lerner index, elasticities).\n",
    "3. Distinguish between **Cournot** and **Bertrand** competition and see why Bertrand is the natural benchmark with differentiated products.\n",
    "4. Understand the basic structure of:\n",
    "   - The simple **Multinomial Logit** model,\n",
    "   - The **Nested Logit** model,\n",
    "   - The **BLP (Berry–Levinsohn–Pakes)** random-coefficients logit approach at a conceptual level.\n",
    "5. Implement, in Python:\n",
    "   - A **logit demand estimation** with aggregate market shares,\n",
    "   - A **nested logit demand estimation** with segments as nests,\n",
    "   - Construction and use of **BLP-style instruments** for price and nest share endogeneity.\n",
    "6. Compute **own- and cross-price elasticities** and **implied marginal costs** from the estimated model.\n",
    "\n",
    "We’ll do this through a **hands-on example** using the European car market, closely following the structure of problem sets used in empirical IO courses, but treated here as a guided lecture rather than an assignment."

    "## 1. Why do we estimate demand?\n",
    "\n",
    "In IO and antitrust, **demand** is not just \"how much people buy\". It is a **function** that links quantities (or market shares) to:\n",
    "  - Prices,\n",
    "  - Product characteristics (quality, horsepower, fuel efficiency, etc.),\n",
    "  - Income and other demand shifters,\n",
    "  - Unobserved factors (brand reputation, design, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "Why we care:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Pricing and markups**\n",
    "   - If we know the **own-price elasticity** of a product, and we have some assumptions on competition (e.g. Bertrand pricing), we can infer **markups** and **marginal costs**.\n",
    "   - This is key for measuring **market power**.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Merger analysis**\n",
    "   - Competition authorities want to know:\n",
    "     - If two firms merge, how will they change prices?\n",
    "     - Which products are close substitutes?\n",
    "   - Demand estimation allows you to simulate how **prices and quantities** move after a merger.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Policy simulations**\n",
    "   - \"What if\" questions:\n",
    "     - What if we impose a tax/subsidy on certain products (e.g., fuel-inefficient cars)?\n",
    "     - What if a new product enters or an existing product exits?\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Product design and differentiation**\n",
    "   - Firms can use demand estimates to decide:\n",
    "     - Which segment to target,\n",
    "     - Whether to launch a new variant (e.g., SUV vs compact).\n",
    "\n",
    "In short: estimating demand is essential for **measuring market power** and for **counterfactual analysis** in IO and antitrust."

    "### **Interpretation:**  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Price Parameter\n",
    "OLS underestimates price sensitivity because high-quality cars tend to have high prices. This positive correlation biases OLS toward a **flatter** demand curve.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Using BLP-style IVs removes this endogeneity, making the demand curve **steeper** (more elastic).  \n",
    "Nested IV shows the strongest correction because both **price** and **within-segment share** are endogenous.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Nesting Parameter $(\\sigma)$\n",
    "- Nested OLS: **0.868**  \n",
    "- Nested IV: **0.340**\n",
    "\n",
    "OLS overstates how close substitutes cars are within the same segment.  \n",
    "After IV correction, substitution within segment becomes more **moderate**, which is more realistic.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Implications\n",
    "- IV models imply **more elastic demand** and therefore **lower markups** than OLS suggests.  \n",
    "- Nested IV is the best structural approximation:  \n",
    "  - Corrects for endogeneity  \n",
    "  - Allows for realistic substitution patterns  \n",
    "- Results are consistent with expectations from empirical IO and BLP-style demand estimation.\n",
    "\n",
    "OLS is biased; IV and Nested IV produce more credible, economically meaningful demand estimates.\n"

    "#### Interpretation of Nested IV Elasticities and Markups\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **1. Nested IV Own-Price Elasticities**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mean elasticity = −3.74**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Demand is **elastic** on average: a 1% price increase lowers quantity by about **3.7%**.\n",
    "- Typical for auto markets after correcting for price and nesting endogeneity.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Distribution:**\n",
    "- **25th to 75th percentile:** −4.57 to −2.46  \n",
    "- **Least elastic product:** −1.14 (still elastic)  \n",
    "- **Most elastic product:** −16.33 (highly responsive niche models)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Implication:**  \n",
    "Consumers are **very price-responsive**. Firms cannot raise prices much without losing substantial sales.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **2. Nested IV Markups**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mean markup = 0.323 (32.3%)**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Firms charge, on average, a **32% markup over marginal cost**.\n",
    "- This reflects **moderate market power** in a differentiated product market.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Distribution:**\n",
    "- **Middle 50%:** 21.9% to 40.6% markups  \n",
    "- **Highest:** 87.8% (premium or highly differentiated models)  \n",
    "- **Lowest:** 6% (very competitive models)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Implication:**  \n",
    "The market is neither perfectly competitive nor highly monopolistic—firms have **meaningful but limited pricing power**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Short Summary**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Elastic demand** (elasticities around −3.7) means consumers react strongly to price changes.  \n",
    "- **Moderate markups** (~32%) indicate differentiated products with some market power.  \n",
    "- These results are **consistent with empirical IO findings** for car markets.\n"

    "## 6. Connecting back to BLP and antitrust applications\n",
    "\n",
    "What we did:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Started from the **structural utility model** underlying discrete choice:\n",
    "   - Utility depends on price and characteristics.\n",
    "2. Used the **Berry (1994, 1995)** insight:\n",
    "   - Aggregate logit can be written as a **linear regression** in $\\ln(s_j / s_0)$.\n",
    "3. Extended to **nested logit** to relax the IIA assumption and capture within-segment substitution.\n",
    "4. Addressed **price endogeneity** (and nest-share endogeneity) using **BLP-style instruments**.\n",
    "5. Computed **elasticities** and **marginal costs** under **Bertrand pricing**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conceptually, **BLP** adds one more layer:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Instead of assuming all consumers share the same β and α (representative consumer),\n",
    "- BLP allows these parameters to vary across individuals (random coefficients),\n",
    "- This leads to **richer substitution patterns** and more realistic simulations.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Competition authorities (like PCC, EC, US-DOJ, CMA) use variants of these models to:\n",
    "  - Evaluate **mergers**,\n",
    "  - Analyze **remedies**,\n",
    "  - Assess **dominance** and **abuse of dominance**,\n",
    "  - Design **sectoral regulations**.\n",
    "\n",
    "For teaching undergrads, this notebook gives:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A **concrete bridge** from econometrics to modern IO demand estimation,\n",
    "- With **Python code** that mirrors the Stata-based exercises often used in advanced IO courses."
